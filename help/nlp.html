The Power of NLP++
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest challenges for NLP technologies
is what is called "coreference": the ability to
consolidate information about enities and events
across a text. This demo analyzer demonstrates 
how this can be done using NLP++.

NLP++ is based on a cognitive model that recogizes
that natural language understanding (NLU) involves 
dictionaries, rules, a parse tree of the current
text, knowledge, and short and longterm memory,
all working together.
