Impossible with Regex or Python
</p>
<p>
One problem programmers face is trying to parse
text that was previously formatted and then saved
as text. This is a task is easy for we humans
but programmimg it using Regex or with Python
is impossible.

read and understand text, including text that used
to contain formatting.
